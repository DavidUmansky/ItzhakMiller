                        Cantor, singer, and composer was born in Israel and educated in San Francisco California
                        . Miller acquired his formal musical education during the years 1965-1981 in San Francisco
                        at the music departments of the Junior High and High Schools he attended and at Antioch
                        University where he
                        completed a B.A. in music. Miller was trained by well known cantors in California and Israel and
                        has served as cantor in various
                        communities both in Diaspora and in Israel. Itzhak's special relationship with R' Shlomo and his
                        music began in the 1960's and since then became a faithful student,
                        both musically and spiritually.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Miller performed with R' Shlomo on many occasions during the last thirty years of R' Shlomo's
                        life both
                        in America and in Israel. Itzhak took part in the recording of two of R' Shlomo's record albums,
                        "Days Are Coming" and "The Gift Of Shabbos".
                        Perhaps most relevant to this recording is the fact that Miller had the privilege of praying
                        alongside R' Shlomo on many Shabbats and Holidays in places
                        such as The House of Love and Prayer in San Francisco where the first Carlebach Minyan was born,
                        and Minyanimm that were oraganized later in Los Angeles, New York, Moshav Modiin, and Jerusalem.

                    <p>
                        In concerts, Miller performs R' Shlomo's cantorial, melodic and soulful compositions as well as
                        known compositions of his own. The lyrical voice of Itzhak Miller can express at times pure
                        prayer and
                        at times great joy and is imbued with an authentic Jewish feeling and rythm. Inspired by his
                        Rebbe, R' Shlomo, Itzhak's singing can create an atmosphere that is filled with a profound love
                        for
                        G-od and his Torah, for the people of Israel and the land of Israel. Yitzhak's musical concerts
                        were broadcast live on T.V at the Israeli "Arutz Ha-Rishon" national channel during the
                        1990's-2000's.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The great love for R' Shlomo's music and the sprouting up of the Carlebach Minyanim all over the
                        world has inspired the making of the first Itzhak's album "Halel" that contains sections of the
                        known prayer that Jews prey in holidays and in the monthly Rosh-Hodesh at the start of the
                        month. It aims to enable these many Minyanimm
                        to conduct their services in the Carlebach style and spirit and in the way that R' Shlomo would
                        have wanted. The disc version of the album released in 2005 and today all the songs available free at the Internet. 
                        You can listen to part of them here in the website.
